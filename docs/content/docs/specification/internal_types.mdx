## BaseNode

BaseNode is a base type for all nodes in the system: LLMNode, ToolNode, or Node. If you see this type in a specification, it means the node can be any of these types.

## Edge

An Edge allows you to define a connection between nodes using a DSL condition.

```yaml
when: LimanCE | FunctionRef
target: BaseNode | BaseNode[]
id: Optional[ID]
depends: Optional[ID | ID[]]
```

import { TypeTable } from "fumadocs-ui/components/type-table";

<TypeTable
  type={{
    when: {
      type: "LimanCE | FunctionRef",
      description: "Condition that must be met for the edge to be followed.",
      required: true,
    },
    target: {
      type: "BaseNode | BaseNode[]",
      description: "The target node(s) that the edge connects to.",
      required: true,
    },
    id: {
      type: "EdgeID",
      description:
        "Optional ID for the edge, can be used to reference the edge. Must be unique with the same parent node.",
      required: false,
    },
    depends: {
      type: "EdgeID | EdgeID[]",
      description:
        "Optional EdgeID or array of EdgeIDs that this edge depends on. The edge will only be followed if the dependencies are resolved.",
      required: false,
    },
  }}
/>

### EdgeID

Any string or number used to identify an edge within a node. It must be unique within the same parent node.

```
<edge-id> ::= <string> | <number>
```

### LimanCE

LimanCE is a DSL CE (Condition Expression) that is used to determine whether an edge should be followed, based on the current context or state. It is typically a string that uses a simple domain-specific language (DSL) to reference variables, node outputs, or builtin functions.

#### Builtin Functions

These functions provide access to common operations and context information within LimanCE conditions.

- `$is_error(error_type?: string, ...)`  
  Checks if the current execution context contains any active error. Returns True if an error is present, False otherwise.
  Can optionally check for a specific error type (e.g., `UnauthorizedError`) or multiple error types.
- `$now()`  
  Returns the current UTC timestamp.  
  **Example:** `$now() > some_variable_timestamp`

#### Example

```js
(value == true && another_value != 1) || $is_error(UnauthorizedError);
```

#### BNF

```
<liman-ce> ::= <term> (("&&" | "and" | "||" | "or") <term>)*

<term> ::= <factor> (("==" | "!=" | ">" | "<" | ">=" | "<=" | "in" | "not in") <factor>)*
         | ("!" | "not") <term>
         | "(" <expression> ")"

<factor> ::= <literal> | <variable> | <function_call>

<literal> ::= <string> | <number> | "true" | "false" | "null"

<variable> ::= IDENTIFIER ("." IDENTIFIER)*

<function_call> ::= BUILTIN_IDENTIFIER "(" [<arg_list>] ")"

<arg_list> ::= <variable> ("," <variable>)*

(* --- Token Definitions --- *)
(* IDENTIFIER: A standard variable name, e.g., 'user', 'role'. *)
(* BUILTIN_IDENTIFIER: A function name prefixed with '$', e.g., '$is_error', '$now'. *)
```

## FunctionRef

FunctionRef is a reference to a function that can be called when the edge is followed. It is typically a string that represents the path to the function, such as `module.path.to.method`. The function should return a boolean value indicating whether the edge should be followed.

## InlinedType

Some types can be declared inline, meaning they can be defined directly within a parent node instead of as separate, standalone declarations. This is useful for simple configurations or when you want to keep related declarations together.

When a type is inlined, the system automatically generates a unique name using the pattern `{parent_name}__inlined__{id}_{type_name}`. The inlined object is only accessible within its parent declaration and cannot be referenced globally through the Registry.

### Example

Instead of creating a separate ServiceAccount declaration, you can inline it directly within a node:

```yaml
kind: LLMNode
node: StartNode
---
auth:
  service_account:
    credentials_provider: CredentialsProvider
```

This would create a ServiceAccount similar to:

```yaml
kind: ServiceAccount
name: LLMNode:StartNode__inlined_{id}_ServiceAccount
credentials_provider: CredentialsProvider
```

The generated ServiceAccount exists only within the scope of the `LLMNode` and cannot be referenced by other nodes or accessed through the global Registry.

## LanguageBundle

LanguageBundle is a string or dictionary with localization support for text.
It uses language codes as keys at any depth.
Any text without a language code is considered default language text.
You can use `{template_variable}` syntax within the text.

```yaml
prompts:
  system:
    en: You are a helpful assistant.
    ru: Ты полезный помощник.
  notes:
    en: |
      Notes: {notes}
    de: |
      Notizen: {notes}
```

This would be converted to the following if `en` is the fallback and default language:

```yaml
prompts:
  en:
    system: You are a helpful assistant.
    notes: |
      Notes: {notes}
  ru:
    system: Ты полезный помощник.
    notes: |
      Notes: {notes}
  ru:
    system: You are a helpful assistant.
    notes: |
      Notizen: {notes}
```
