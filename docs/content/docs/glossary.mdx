## A - E

#### Agent

High-level entity that orchestrates workflow execution, wraps [Executor](#executor), stateless.

#### CE DSL

Custom Conditional Expression DSL used to define conditions and expressions in the system. It allows complex logic to be expressed in a declarative manner in [Spec](#spec).

#### Component

Every [Spec](#spec) is parsed to a [Component](#component), which is a basic building block of the system - [Nodes](#node), [ServiceAccount](#serviceaccount), etc.

#### Context

A set of variables that can be injected into components from external state, providing additional information needed for execution.

#### CredentialsProvider

A phantom specification that provides authentication credentials to [ServiceAccount](#serviceaccount) at runtime. Not declared in YAML but registered in the Registry.

#### Edge

Connection between nodes that defines routing logic and conditional flow control using [CE DSL](#ce-dsl).

#### Executor

An instance that executes the workflow, orchestrating execution flow and managing workflow state, stateful.

## F - N

#### FunctionNode

A specific type of [Node](#node) that represents custom user-defined logic.

#### LanguageBundle

A specification for multi-language text content, allowing localization and templating support.

#### LLMNode

A specific type of [Node](#node) that represents a Large Language Model (LLM) and is used to process natural language inputs and generate outputs.

#### Node

A specific type of [Component](#component) that represents a single unit of work or functionality within the system - [LLMNode](#llmnode), [FunctionNode](#functionnode), [ToolNode](#toolnode).

#### NodeActor

Component that manages role assumption, state, and node wrapping during execution, serving as an intermediary between the executor and individual nodes.

## O - U

#### Overlay

Specific [Spec](#spec) that applies to another basic [Spec](#spec) to extend or modify it.

#### Plugin

Extensible component that adds custom functionality to node specifications without hardcoding logic. Plugins follow a standard interface and can extend multiple spec types (e.g., AuthPlugin for authentication).

#### Registry

Central repository for managing and storing component definitions, credentials providers, plugins, and other runtime resources.

#### ServiceAccount

An identity used by NodeActor to execute nodes, providing authentication and authorization context for external service access.

#### Spec

YAML declaration, basic block of the system, which is parsed to a [Component](#component).

#### ToolNode

A specific type of [Node](#node) that enables function calling capabilities for LLMs.
